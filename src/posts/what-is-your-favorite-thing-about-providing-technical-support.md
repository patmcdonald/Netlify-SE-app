I enjoy providing technical support, because I rejoice in other peoples successes. I also get great satisfaction from helping someone, and  really enjoy diving into a problem and troubleshooting.

In finding solutions for customers. I get to hone my craft in writing, code and problem-solving. 
And, as a life-long learner. I feel that being confident, yet willing to always learn, and teach others, is the path to mastering skills.

In teaching others, we can hone our skills and begin to master them.
