I find joy in the success of others, and  supporting people is what I've always done, and will aways do.

In providing technical support - I'm constantly learning, and not just about new features or the satisfaction of troubleshooting. To me, it's all about communicating with people. It's service to others, combined with an technical mindset, and I really enjoy that challenge.

In finding solutions for customers. I get to hone my craft in writing, coding and problem-solving.  And, as a life-long learner. I feel that being confident, yet willing to always learn and teach others, is the path to  skills mastery.
