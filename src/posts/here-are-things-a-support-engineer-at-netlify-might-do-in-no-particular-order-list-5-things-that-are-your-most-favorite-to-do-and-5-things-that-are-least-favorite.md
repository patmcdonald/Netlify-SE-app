Hi Chris. 

I've taken a fresh look at this list after our conversation, and made my choices in light of that. I've listed them in no particular order, and there's activities that I'd really enjoy off the list too. These would include working with the development team, bug reports and debugging, and recruiting new Support teammates.

### My 5 favourite activities from this list are:

* Dig through server logs to troubleshoot a customer's website behavior
* Spot trends across many cases to improve Netlify's product and service
* Help train and onboard new support teammates
* Write and maintain documentation for our software and blog posts for our website.
* Work with people to figure out if Netlify's service can solve a particular workflow or integration challenge they have

### My 5 least favourite activities from this list are:

* Receive occasional phone calls requesting support from our highest-value customers
* Engage multiple users at once via chat to answer their questions and troubleshoot problems
* Deliver a talk to many people you don't know at a conference or meetup
* Manage a Support team 
* Respond to Netlify customers on Twitter
