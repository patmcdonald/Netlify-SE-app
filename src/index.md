I've setup this site as my take home task for my application.

I'd recently read about [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) as a simple static site generator that's gaining popularity. In reading about it I found a version thats preconfigured with [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/). I approached this with a "beginners mind". That is, someone who just wants to get a simple site up and running, and is currently finding their way around Git and the JAMstack approach to creating web applications.

I began by [deploying Hylia to Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/hankchizljaw/hylia&stack=cms), and cloned my repo locally.
